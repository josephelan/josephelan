<h1>👋 Hello and Welcome!! 👋</h1>

<p>
My name is <b>Joseph Lan</b> (He/ Him / His)! I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science and software engineering at the University of Washington Bothell. I started this journey because I have a passion for problem solving and finding solutions and I love technology and computing! I believe that technology has and can create powerfully impactful experiences people and I want to contribute to that! Have a look around at my journey and progression through my various school coursework projects and self projects that I am working on!
</p>

I'm currently working through these UDEMY / online courses to brush up on fundamentals and learn some new tools to add to my toolbelt alongside University schoolwork.
