### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joseph (He/ Him / His)! I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science and software engineering at the University of Washington Bothell.

I started this journey because I have a passion for problem solving and finding solutions, and I love technology and computing! I believe that technology has and can create powerfully impactful experiences people and I want to contribute to that!

Have a look around at my journey and progression through my various school coursework projects and self projects that I am working on!

I'm currently working through these UDEMY / online courses to brush up and learn some new tools to add to my toolbelt, combined with my schoolwork.
  1. Java Programming: Complete Beginner to Advanced
  2. HTML,CSS, & Bootstrap Certification Course for Beginners
  3. Pyomo Bootcamp: Python Optimization from Beginner to Advance
  4. Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond

I'd love to talk to you more. Please contact me at jeconomylan@gmail.com if you have any questions regarding my work, or just want to chat and collaborate!
